# An Example App For Adding User Authentication with Authgear and OAuth 2.0 to a Regular PHP Website.

## What is Authgear?
Authgear is a secure authentication and user management platform. It uses OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 to identify who a user is and grant authorization to protected resources.

This example app is written in regular PHP without any framework. It uses Authgear to allow users to log in to a website and request protected resources.

## How to Run the Project
Before you run this project on your local machine, sign up for a free Authgear account, create an Authgear app, and add the configuration to the PHP script.
